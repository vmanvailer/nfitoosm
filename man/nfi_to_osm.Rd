\usage{
nfi_to_osm(
  nfi_folder,
  scenario_name = "nfi_simulation",
  remeasurement_number = NULL,
  calculate_stockable = TRUE,
  fill_age_gaps = TRUE,
  provinces = c("New Brunswick", "Prince Edward Island", "Nova Scotia",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nfi_folder}{String. The path to the folder containing the NFI data.}

\item{scenario_name}{String. The name of the OSM growth scenario to be populated into the 'Scenario' column of Stand List Table.}

\item{remeasurement_number}{Integer. NFI numbers to individualize each field campaign. Starts at '0' (plot establishment) and the following numbers in the sequence are remeasurements.}

\item{calculate_stockable}{Logical. Refer to the optional OSM column "Stockable" defaults to \code{TRUE}.
OSM uses this information to adjust calculation when projecting a stand growth. Use if it is known that there are portions of the site that are portions of the plot that do not support tree growth (e.g. roads or other).

On NFI, this information may be contained in two variables: \code{meas_plot_size} and \code{nom_plot_size}. The actual measured area (in ha) of plots (meas_plot_size) may be different than the designed size of the plot (nom_plot_size). nominal plot size is standardized to 400 square meters (or 0.04 ha).
This may happen because sites are assigned to the center of randomly established photo plots and may fall partially on non-forested areas e.g. road, or other non-productive areas.

However, it is important to note that there may be other reasons for not measuring the entire plot (fallen tree, inaccessible private property or other safety reason).

If \code{TRUE} will calculate ratio of measured size (ha) to nominal size (ha) and assume unmeasured portions are unproductive, otherwise will use nominal size (ha) and assume the entire plot is productive.
Also, if using \code{meas_num = 0} there is a higher chance fully productive plots being incompletely measured (due to cost issues). See page 12 of \link[https://nfi.nfis.org/resources/groundplot/GP_compilation_procedures_2.4.pdf]{Compilation Procedures}}

\item{provinces}{Vector of strings. Provinces for which you want data for. Will only retrieve data for one of the four provinces in the argument default.}

\item{model_variant}{Vector of string. OSM has two models. The "Acadian" model variant has been calibrated for the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. The "Newfoundland and Labrador" model has been calibrated for Newfoundland and Labrador only.}

\item{only_remeasured_trees}{Logical. Defaults to FALSE to maximize data use. Ignored if querying a single re measurement number. Will include ingrowth trees and remeasured trees. Ingrowth trees are small trees that crossed the threshold of DBH >= 9cm between remeasurements. May cause large increase in biomass.}

\item{include_small_trees}{Logical. Defaults to true to maximize data use and ignored if only_remeasured_trees = TRUE. Will include all individual trees measured on the small plot data. See page 32 of \link[https://nfi.nfis.org/resources/groundplot/Gp_guidelines_v5.0.pdf]{Ground Plot Guidelines}.}

\item{dbh_filter}{Numeric. A field to filter out trees based on DBH. Will pick DBH higher than or equal to this value.}

\item{output_path}{String. Use to output the SQLite database that can be passed to OSM.}

\item{fill_survey_age}{Logical. Fill SurveyAge for t-1 when SurveyAge is available for time t.

Important: SurveyAge is extracted from site_age variable in NFI table all_gp_ltp_header.csv. site_age variable is calculated as the average age of all trees in the plot and may not align with time lapsed between re measurements.
For example, nfi_plot 916316 has site_age of 52 at meas_num == 0 and 59 at meas_num == 1 (7 years of difference) even though they were measured 12 years apart.}

\value{
Returns a list with two data frames (data.tables) and a writes a database on specified output_path. The data frames should match the input data exactly as in \link[https://forusresearch.com/downloads/osm/help/OSM.HelpFiles/OSM.Input.htm]{Open Stand Model}.

\item{SurveyYear}{The year from \code{meas_date} in \emph{all_gp_site_info.csv} NFI data.}
\item{SurveyAge}{The stand age from \code{site_age} in \emph{all_gp_ltp_header.csv} NFI data. Uses arithmetic average age of trees deemed suitable for compiling site age. For more details see page 129 of \link[https://nfi.nfis.org/resources/groundplot/Gp_guidelines_v5.0.pdf]{Ground Plot Guidelines}.}
\item{Plots}{Number of plots for a given stand. Defaults to 1 where each NFI plot will assumed to represent a stand.}
\item{Stockable}{Ratio of total sample area (all plots) that supports productive tree growth. Calculated as described in \code{calculate_stockable}}

\item{Species}{NFI Species are mapped to OSM species based on the \code{Acadian_SpeciesList} table contained in the \link[https://forusresearch.com/downloads/osm/OSMv2.25.1/OSMv2.25.1_Demo.zip]{OSM demo package}.
NFI codes are mapped to the \code{GENUS} and \code{SPECIES} column of the \code{Acadian_SpeciesList} and the variable \code{OSM_AD_CmdKey} from that table is used.}
\item{DBH}{DBH of individual trees or average DBH for each DBH Bin classes when \code{calculate_ef_for_dbh_bin = TRUE}.}
\item{HT}{Height of individual trees or average height for each DBH Bin classes when \code{calculate_ef_for_dbh_bin = TRUE}.}

\item{Died}{Derived from \code{lgtree_status} (Large trees) or \code{smtree_status} (Small trees). If classified as DS = Dead Standing then it is assigned 9999 to be initialized in the snag pool. LS (Live Stading), LF (Live fallen) or M (Missing) are assumed to as live (set to 0).
Setting to 9999 assumes tree died 7 years ago as per OSM default. Could potentially be improved to check whether tree died between remeasurement and set to value to be year of measurement 2 minus year of measurement 1 divided 2.)}

\description{
This function extracts and properly formats Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to Open Stand Mode (OSM) input format.
It attempts to maximize the use of data but there are still some improvements that can be made to use the full extent of NFI data. Check 'Value' section for more details.
}
\details{
It uses the current NFI data structure in csv files and is based on file naming patterns for ground plot data e.g. "all_gp_trees".
It maximizes the use of data by making several assumptions on which data should be included and how. Several of those assumptions can be changed by the user by modifying the function parameters e.g. calculate_ef_for_dbh_bin = TRUE.
For full details on how each OSM input variable is constructed and which assumptions are made consult the details.
