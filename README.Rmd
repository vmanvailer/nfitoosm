Package build to prepare NFI ground plot data into OSM input data using `data.table`.

To explore what fields exists in NFI ground plot data go to their [documentation page](https://nfi.nfis.org/en/ground_plot).  
To request NFI data you can go to their [form webpage](https://nfi.nfis.org/en/datarequestform).  
Details about Open Stand Model (OSM) are found at [FORUS Research webpage](https://forusresearch.com/downloads/osm/index.html).

# Uses
This package contains only one main function to produce the OSM input that from NFI.
Make sure to explore its documentation `?nfi_to_osm()` to learn about about how you can modify some of the data translation parameters.

```{NFI to OSM}
osm_example <- nfi_to_osm()
```

The function creates the two required data tables Stand List Table and Tree List Table. [OSM Input Data Details](https://forusresearch.com/downloads/osm/help/OSM.HelpFiles/OSM.Input.htm).

```{table header}
osm_example
```
